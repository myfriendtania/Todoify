# TODOIFY

This new project we built is a to do app. Minimal. WE used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
We used the Form element to add submit and text input; his provides ineractive elements to our users. 
We used an event handler to add functionality to the form and used an event object to prevent it from refreshing the page. We also used a variable to store input text and use that tect to create new to-do items to add to our list.


## Future enhancements
- The ability to cross off items
- Hide crossed off items
- group items
